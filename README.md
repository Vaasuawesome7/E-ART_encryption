The algorithm is compared with the well-known DES algorithm and by the results we conclude that it performs as good as DES algorithm in terms of encryption and finishes it much faster.

Metrics used are:
- Time consumed and memory required for execution
- Avalanche effect
- Frequency distribution graph

A simple TCP network is made and files are encrypted/decrypted in the respective client and server sides
